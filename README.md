# Cpp_Prac

After starting working at industry, I gradually realize that: my daily work does not have too much to do with algorithm and data structure. In the mean time, C++ used in Microsoft, at least the C++ used in MSFT SQL engine, is not the real C++. It's more like c-style language. I would like to take up to 30 mins every day to finish some simple coding test in C++, and familiarize myself with standard C++. Everyone is welcome to join that! #CodeAfterWorkEveryday
